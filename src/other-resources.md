## Programming Resources

### Free Ebook Foundation

* [free-programming-books repository](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books).

	* A vast collection of reading, audio, video, interactive, and course material on just about every programming topic you can think of.
	
	* One great book I found in the free-programming-books repository is Eric S. Raymond's [*The Art of Unix Programming*](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/). (Note: That link hosts a complete HTML version of book, but the website uses HTTP, not HTTPS. If you want an HTTPS site, [you can get an overview on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0131429019/104-5607387-8275944?v=glance) or search online).

		* It's about operating system design, and although it was published in 2003, many of the operating systems, tools, programming languages, and philosophies it references are still in use today, which might help you better connect to what he wrote.

		* I think everyone can find at least one section in there that interests them, so I highly recommend you take a look.

### MIT

* [missing-semester repository](https://github.com/missing-semester/missing-semester).

	* A course covering practices and tools that you may not be formally taught, such as version control, security measures, and virtual machines.

### Wiki Knights

* [cs-materials repository](https://github.com/wikiknights/cs-materials).

	* An expanding collection of teaching materials for computer science.

## Non-Programming Resources

### Project Gutenberg

* [Project Gutenberg website](https://www.gutenberg.org/).

	* A collection of free eBooks available in various file formats.
